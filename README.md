# NLP-with-Disaster-tweets
Problem statement:  The goal of this project focused on text classification. It aims to classify tweets related to natural disasters into two categories: tweets that are related to real disasters (e.g., actual emergencies, warnings, or news reports) and tweets that are unrelated (e.g., jokes, figurative language, or non-emergencyÂ context).
