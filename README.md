### Capstone Project: Disaster Tweet Classification

Developed a text classification model to categorize tweets related to natural disasters as either "real disasters" (e.g., emergencies, warnings) or "unrelated" (e.g., jokes, figurative language).

**Technical Highlights:**
- **Data Processing:** Imported and visualized tweet datasets to extract insights.
- **Modeling:** Built a BERT model to accurately classify tweets based on relevance.
- **Interface Development:** Created visual outputs for easy analysis and understanding of model performance.
