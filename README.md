# Capstone Project: Disaster Tweet Classification

Developed a text classification model to categorize tweets related to natural disasters as either "real disasters" (e.g., emergencies, warnings) or "unrelated" (e.g., jokes, figurative language).
Technical Highlights:
Data Processing: Imported and visualized tweet datasets for insight extraction.
Modeling: Built a BERT model to accurately classify tweets.
Interface Development: Created visual outputs for easy analysis and understanding of model performance.
